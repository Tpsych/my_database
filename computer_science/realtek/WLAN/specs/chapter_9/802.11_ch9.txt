Chapter 9: Mac sublayer functional introduction

9-1 Introduction
    MAC layer is the sublayer of Data-link layer

    The MAC sublayer channel access control mechanisms that
    make it possible for several network nodes to communicate
    within a multiple access network that incorporates a shared medium

9-2 MAC archetecture
    It's important to avoid collision and higher to efficiency of data
    transmission.

    1. DCF:
        Also known as CSMA/CA, a contention-based transfer
    2. PCF:
        There is an AP controling the access for other STAs, a
        contention-free transfer.
    3. HCF:
        802.11e enhance the DCF and PCF, only usable in QoS network.

        3-1 EDCA:
            Enhancement of DCF, introduce TXOP, contention-based.
        3-2 HCCA:
            Enhancement of PCF, hybrid coordinator collocated with
            the AP, controls the access to the medium.
    4. MCF:
        Only usable in MBSS, has both contention-based and contention-free
        mechanism. EDCA for contention-based, MCCA for contention-free.

9-3 DCF
    Use RTS/CTS to avoid contention conflicts and hidden nodes problem.
    NAV is used to preserve a period of usage time

    Dual CTS: to make CTS hear by both STBC STA and non-STBC STA

    Multiple access technology:
        FDMA;OFDMA;CSMA/CD;CSMA/CA

9-4 PCF
    PC: point coordinator

    DCF and PCF can work simultaneously.
        Contention-free period is protected by NAV(carried in Beacon)
        It's period will last till CF-END

    PCF frame:
        1: transmitted only by PC:
            Data+CF-Poll¡BData+CF-ACK+CF-Poll¡BCF-Poll and CF-ACK+CF-Poll
        2: transmitted by both PC and STA
            Data¡BData+CF-ACK¡BNull and CF-ACK
9-5 Fragmentation and Defragmentation
    Defragmentation:
        According to the frame header:
            1. Frame type
            2. Address of the sender, obtained from the Address2 field
            3. Destination address
            4. Sequence control field: number for defragmentation
            5. More fragmentation indicator
9-11 A-MSDU operation
     Frame aggregation. A-MSDU should have MSDUs with the same DA/SA map
     to the same RA/TA values.

9-19 HCF (Hybrid Coordination Function)
    EDCA and HCCA

    9.19.2 EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access)
        1. Enhancement of DCF
        2. Contention-based
        3. Introduce TXOP
        4. The levels of prority in EDCA are called access categories (ACs)
