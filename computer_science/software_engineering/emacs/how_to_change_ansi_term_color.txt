You can change colors of both the term and ansi-term modes by customizing the term group. The steps are as follow:

    First, run the command customize-group by typing M-x customize-group

    And then type the term group

Now, you are free to change the color of the ansi-term mode. For example, to change the color of folders, in my Emacs setting, I can chang it by modifying the Term Color Green face option.
