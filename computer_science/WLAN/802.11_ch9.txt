9-1 Introduction
    MAC layer is the sublayer of Data-link layer

    The MAC sublayer channel access control mechanisms that
    make it possible for several network nodes to communicate
    within a multiple access network that incorporates a shared medium

9-2 MAC archetecture
    It's important to avoid collision and higher to efficiency of data
    transmission.

    1. DCF:
        Also known as CSMA/CA, a contention-based transfer
    2. PCF:
        There is an AP controling the access for other STAs, a
        contention-free transfer.
    3. HCF:
        802.11e enhance the DCF and PCF, only usable in QoS network.

        3-1 EDCA:
            Enhancement of DCF, introduce TXOP, contention-based.
        3-2 HCCA:
            Enhancement of PCF, hybrid coordinator collocated with
            the AP, controls the access to the medium.
    4. MCF:
        Only usable in MBSS, has both contention-based and contention-free
        mechanism. EDCA for contention-based, MCCA for contention-free.

9-3 DCF
    Use RTS/CTS to avoid contention conflicts and hidden nodes problem.
    NAV is used to preserve a period of usage time

    Dual CTS: to make CTS hear by both STBC STA and non-STBC STA

    Multiple access technology:
