The services and protocols specified in IEEE 802 map to the lower two layers
(Data Link and Physical) of the seven-layer OSI networking reference model.
In fact, IEEE 802 splits the OSI Data Link Layer into two sub-layers named
logical link control (LLC) and media access control (MAC),
 so the layers can be listed like this:

Data link layer
     LLC sublayer
     MAC sublayer

Physical layer
