The services and protocols specified in IEEE 802 map to the lower two layers
(Data Link and Physical) of the seven-layer OSI networking reference model.
In fact, IEEE 802 splits the OSI Data Link Layer into two sub-layers named
logical link control (LLC) and media access control (MAC),
so the layers can be listed like this:

    Data link layer
         LLC sublayer
             Frames the Network layer packet
             Identify the Network layer protocol
         MAC sublayer
             Address the frame
             Mark the begining and end of the frame

    Physical layer

IBSS
    Ad hoc: STA directly communicate with each others
MBSS:
    1. Similar to IBSS, however STA can communicate thru other devices
    2. Mesh STA do not directly communicate with nonmesh STA
    3. Mesh STA communicate with other nonmesh STA thru DS
    4. Data moves between an MBSS and the DS via one or more mesh gate
    5. Two different entities (mesh STA and access point) can exist in
       the collocated device, and the mesh BSS is hidden to STAs that
       associate to the access point. (ref. 13.11.5)
