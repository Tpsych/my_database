CPU --------(I/O request)-------> Device X

Device X's stack:
    driver A: Device_Object_A
    driver B: Device_Object_B
              .
              .
              .
              .
              .

Note:
    1. Device_Object is a structure defined by MS
    2. I/O request is issued by IRP(I/O request packets)

Sometimes more than one device stack is involved in processing an I/O request.
Regardless of how many device stacks are involved, the overall sequence of
drivers that participate in an I/O request is called the driver stack for the
request.
