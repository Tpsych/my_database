1. T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)
2. T(cu) = c T(u)

**Every matix transformation is a linear transformation**

**For every T, there exists an unique matrix A for it. In fact,
A is the m*n matrix whose jth column is the vector T(ej), where 
ej is the jth column of the identitiy matrix in Rn **

Note: c is the scalar
