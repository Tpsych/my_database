A vector space us a bibenot set V of objects, called vectors, on which
are defined two operations, called addition and multiplication by scalars,
subject to the ten axioms. The axioms must hold for all vectors u, v, and w in V 
and for all scalars c and d.

	1. The sum of u and v, denoted by u + v, is in V
	2. u + v = v + u
	3. (u + v) + w = u + (v + w)
	4. There is a zero vector 0 in V, such that u + 0 = u
	5. For each u in V, there is a vector -u in V such that u + 0 = u
	6. The scalar multiple of u by c, denoted by cu, is in V
	7. c(u + v) = cu + cv
	8. (c + d)u = cu + du
	9. c(du) = (cd)u
	10. 1u = u
