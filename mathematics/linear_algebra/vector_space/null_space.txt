Consider the following system of homogeneous equations:

	X1 - 3X2 -2X3 = 0
	-5X1 + 9X2 + X3 = 0

In matrix form, the system is written as Ax = 0, where

	A = [1  -3  -2
             -5  9   1 ]

Recall that the set of all x that satisfy the homogeneous
equations is called the solution set of the system.

Often it is convenient to relate this set directly to the
Matrix A and the equation Ax = 0.

We call the set if x that satisfy Ax = 0 the null space of 
the matrix A.

	Nul A = {x:x is in Rn and Ax = 0}
