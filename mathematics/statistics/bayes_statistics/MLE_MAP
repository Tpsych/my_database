wikipedia:
    From the point of view of Bayesian inference, MLE is a special case of maximum a 
    posteriori estimation (MAP) that assumes a uniform prior distribution of the parameters.

    In frequentist inference, MLE is one of several methods to get estimates of parameters 
    without using prior distributions.
